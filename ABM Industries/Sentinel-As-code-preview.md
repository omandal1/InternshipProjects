Sentinel as Code
What is it?
Azure DevOps is a suite of development tools and services provided by Microsoft to support the entire software development lifecycle. It includes:
•	Azure Repos: Source control using Git.
•	Azure Pipelines: CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) automation.
•	Azure Boards: Agile project management tools.
•	Azure Artifacts: Package management.
•	Azure Test Plans: Testing tools for quality assurance.
Azure DevOps enables teams to plan work, collaborate on code development, and build and deploy applications efficiently.

Why use a Repository?
Aspect	Azure DevOps	Microsoft Teams
Versioning	Full Git history	None
Collaboration	Branching, pull requests, reviews	Manual sharing
Automation	CI/CD pipelines	Not supported
Security	Role-based access, audit logs	Limited control
Scalability	Designed for enterprise DevOps	Not suitable for code deployment
Using Teams to share code is informal and error-prone. Azure DevOps provides a structured, secure, and scalable way to manage and deploy Sentinel content.

Why DevOps is preferred
While GitHub is a powerful platform for version control and collaboration, Azure DevOps offers several advantages in enterprise environments:
Feature	Azure DevOps	GitHub
Integrated CI/CD	Built-in with Azure Pipelines	Requires GitHub Actions or external tools
Project Management	Native Boards for Agile/Scrum	GitHub Projects (less mature)
Security & Compliance	Enterprise-grade, Azure-native	Strong, but less integrated with Azure
Permissions & Policies	Granular control, AD integration	Simpler, GitHub-based
Artifacts & Testing	Built-in Artifacts and Test Plans	Requires third-party integrations

Implementation:
Method one (Native Repository Integration in Microsoft Sentinel)
This method uses Microsoft Sentinel’s built-in support for syncing content from GitHub or Azure DevOps repositories.
✅ Prerequisites
•	Owner or equivalent permissions on the Sentinel workspace
•	GitHub or Azure DevOps repo with supported content (e.g., analytic rules in JSON or Bicep)
•	Repo must be in the same tenant as Sentinel 
1
🛠️ Steps to Set Up
1.	Prepare Your Repository
•	Organize content in folders like:
•	/AnalyticRules/
•	/Workbooks/
•	/Playbooks/
•	Use supported formats: JSON (for rules), Bicep (for infrastructure)
2.	Go to Microsoft Sentinel
•	Open the Microsoft Sentinel workspace in the Azure or Defender portal
•	Navigate to Content Management > Repositories
3.	Create a Repository Connection
•	Click + Add repository
•	Choose GitHub or Azure DevOps
•	Authenticate and select:
•	Repo
•	Branch
•	Root folder (e.g., /SentinelContent)
•	Assign a name and click Create
4.	Validate and Sync
•	Sentinel will automatically validate the content
•	If valid, it will deploy the content to your workspace
•	You can monitor sync status and errors in the portal

Method two (Sentinel-As-Code with Azure DevOps Pipelines)
1.	Import the Sentinel-As-Code Repo
•	Use this repo: Sentinel-As-Code on GitHub 
2
•	In Azure DevOps:
•	Go to Repos > Import
•	Paste the GitHub URL or upload the ZIP
2.	Review the Repo Structure
3.	/Bicep/
4.	  ├── main.bicep
5.	  └── sentinel.bicep
6.	/Scripts/
7.	  └── Set-SentinelContent.ps1
8.	azure-pipelines.yml
9.	Create a Service Connection
•	Go to Project Settings > Service Connections
•	Add an Azure Resource Manager connection
•	Use it in the pipeline as azureSubscription
10.	Configure the Pipeline
•	Go to Pipelines > New Pipeline
•	Choose YAML and point to azure-pipelines.yml
•	Customize variables like:
11.	Run the Pipeline
•	Commit a change or manually trigger the pipeline
•	It will:
•	Deploy infrastructure via Bicep
•	Deploy analytic rules via PowerShell

More info about method two
To manage and deploy Microsoft Sentinel content as code, we use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles, typically with ARM templates, Bicep, or Sentinel as Code (SAC) frameworks. The deployment process involves storing content in a Git repository and using Azure Pipelines to automate deployment.
6.1 Analytics Rules
Purpose: Detect threats and suspicious activities in your environment.
Deployment Steps:
•	Define rules in JSON format (based on ARM templates or SAC schema).
•	Store them in a structured folder (e.g., Sentinel/AnalyticsRules/).
•	Use a pipeline task to deploy via:
•	az sentinel alert-rule create (CLI)
•	ARM/Bicep deployment
•	Include validation steps to check for syntax and schema compliance.
Pipeline Example:
 
6.2 Automation Rules
Purpose: Automatically respond to incidents by triggering actions like tagging, assigning, or running playbooks.
Deployment Steps:
•	Define automation rules in JSON format.
•	Store in Sentinel/AutomationRules/.
•	Deploy using:
•	az sentinel automation-rule create
•	ARM templates
Best Practice: Use rule order and conditions to avoid conflicts.
________________________________________
6.3 Hunting Queries
Purpose: Proactively search for threats using KQL (Kusto Query Language).
Deployment Steps:
•	Store .kql files in Sentinel/HuntingQueries/.
•	Use a script or pipeline task to import them using:
•	az sentinel hunting-rule create
•	REST API or PowerShell
Tip: Include metadata like tactics, techniques (MITRE ATT&CK), and description in a YAML or JSON wrapper.
________________________________________
6.4 Parsers (Custom Logs / Normalization)
Purpose: Normalize and transform raw data into a usable format for Sentinel.
Deployment Steps:
•	Define parsers as KQL functions.
•	Store in Sentinel/Parsers/ as .kql files.
•	Deploy using:
•	az monitor log-analytics workspace data-export create
•	REST API for saved functions
Note: Ensure parsers are tested in a dev workspace before production deployment.
________________________________________
6.5 Playbooks
Purpose: Automate incident response using Azure Logic Apps.
Deployment Steps:
•	Define playbooks as ARM templates or Logic App JSON definitions.
•	Store in Sentinel/Playbooks/.
•	Deploy using:
•	az deployment group create with ARM template
•	Azure DevOps ARM deployment task
Pipeline Snippet:
 
6.6 Workbooks
Purpose: Visualize data and create dashboards for monitoring and investigation.
Deployment Steps:
•	Define workbooks in JSON format.
•	Store in Sentinel/Workbooks/.
•	Deploy using:
•	az monitor workbook create
•	ARM templates
Best Practice: Parameterize workbook templates for reusability across environments.
Comparison of both methods:
Why Use Native Repository Integration (Method 1)?
🔹 Pros:
•	Simple setup: Just connect your GitHub or Azure DevOps repo in the Sentinel UI.
•	Automatic syncing: Sentinel pulls in content like analytic rules, workbooks, and playbooks automatically.
•	No pipeline needed: No need to write YAML, manage service connections, or build CI/CD logic.
•	Great for small to medium teams or those who want to manage content declaratively.
🔸 When to Use:
•	You want to version control your Sentinel content.
•	You don’t need complex deployment logic.
•	You’re working in a single environment (e.g., just production).
________________________________________
 Why Use Sentinel-As-Code with Azure DevOps Pipelines (Method 2)?
🔹 Pros:
•	Full control: You can add logic, validations, approvals, and branching strategies.
•	Multi-environment support: Easily deploy to dev, test, and prod with different parameters.
•	Infrastructure-as-Code: Deploy not just content, but also the Sentinel workspace, Log Analytics, and more.
•	Custom workflows: Integrate with other tools, run tests, or notify teams.
🔸 When to Use:
•	You need complex deployment scenarios.
•	You’re managing multiple environments.
•	You want to automate everything, including infrastructure.
•	You’re part of a larger SecOps or DevSecOps team with strict governance.
